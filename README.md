# Conduct

Daemon Code of Conduct

As contributors and maintainers of this project, and in the interest of fostering an open and welcoming community, we pledge to respect all people who contribute through reporting issues, posting feature requests, updating documentation, submitting pull requests or patches, and other activities.

Since we are a coin built for the Mission to help solve the Opioid Addiction Epidemic, we require mining pools to respect the *10% Dev fee*.  *50%* of our efforts go to our Founding partner SoberLifeUSA as well as the other recovery centers who have signed on to use our coin as payment since the conception of the coin.  This coin will be used to treat patients and help build out needed infrastructure and support staff.

We are committed to making participation in this project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, or nationality.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:
-  The use of sexualized language or imagery
-  Personal attacks
-  Trolling or insulting/derogatory comments
-  Public or private harassment
-  Publishing other's private information, such as physical or electronic addresses, without explicit permission
-  Other unethical or unprofessional conduct

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

By adopting this Code of Conduct, project maintainers commit themselves to fairly and consistently applying these principles to every aspect of managing this project. Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct may be permanently removed from the project team.

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting a project maintainer (see below). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. Maintainers are obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.

Advanced Treatment is HERE! This is a Reality and OUR MISSION is to help solve the number one Epidemic, the Opioid Crisis!
